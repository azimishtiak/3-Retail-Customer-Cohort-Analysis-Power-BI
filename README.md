# Customer-Cohort-Analysis-Power-BI
This customer cohort analysis provides retention and churn dynamics of customers over time. The customers are from a retail company. The analysis tracks groups of customers based on their acquisition time and analyzes their behavior over time. It helps businesses understand retention trends—how many customers stay active—and churn patterns—how many drop off—across different cohorts. By observing how retention declines and churn increases month-over-month, businesses can identify critical points of customer drop-off and take targeted actions to improve long-term engagement and customer lifetime value.
