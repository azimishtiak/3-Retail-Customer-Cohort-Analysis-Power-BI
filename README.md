### ✔️ Cohort Performance & Retention Rate (%)
Measured the percentage of customers who returned after their initial purchase, revealing strong retention in early months but a gradual decline over time.
### ✔️ Churn Customers & Churn Rate (%)
Identified customers who failed to return, calculating churn rates to highlight critical drop-off points and inform re-engagement strategies.
### ✔️ Cohort Performace Analysis (MoM)
